                <p>
                  <div class="line f3 mb-3">Who believes that the wellspring of compassion or heroism; is self compassion, or becoming a hero to herself or himself first,</div>

                  <div class="line f3 mb-3">Who not only sees by looking at content of character but also the full sum of a person&#x27;s history; and thus will neither falter and fail to liars, nor be taken in by the flawless stories of pretenders,</div>

                  <div class="line f3 mb-3">Who wants the world to know it needs not, its vice and crutch; but wisdom and love only; and once we are free from all the imaginary borders; Wisdom, like gravity will act to converge the Human Family, in Health and Peace, together,</div>
                  <div class="line f3 mb-3">Who believes we cannot be taught and it is up to each of us to seek out wisdom and stand on the shoulders of giants; to inherit and continue their work, and help all the future generations stand on our own shoulders, in return,</div>
