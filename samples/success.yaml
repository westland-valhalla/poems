      - Don't aim at success.

      - The more you aim at it and make it a target, the more you are going to miss it.
      - For success, like happiness, cannot be pursued; it must ensue, and it only does so as the unintended side effect of one's personal dedication to a cause greater than oneself or as the by-product of one's surrender to a person other than oneself.
      - "Happiness must happen, and the same holds for success: you have to let it happen by not caring about it."

    - section:

      - I want you to listen to what your conscience commands you to do and go on to carry it out to the best of your knowledge.
      - Then you will live to see that in the long-run—in the long-run, I say! — success will follow you precisely because you had forgotten to think about it.
